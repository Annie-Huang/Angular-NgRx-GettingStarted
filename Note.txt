Introduction
############################
What Is State?
View State
User Information
Entity Data
User Selection and Input

Use NgRxWhen...
There is state everywhere!
- The store provides a place for UI state to retain it between router views
Getting data again and again!
- The store provides a client-side cache to use as needed
Notify everyone!
- The reducer updates the store and the store notifies all subscribers
Something isn't working!
- It has great tooling

Don't Use NgRxWhen...
Your team is new to Angular
- Ramp up with Angular and RxJSObservables first
The application is simple
- The extra code required for NgRxmay not be worth the effort
Your team has a good pattern
- No need to change if you already have a good state management pattern in place
